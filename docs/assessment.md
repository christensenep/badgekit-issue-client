# Assessment 

BadgeKit facilitates badge issuing via an assessment process. Issuer sites can accept earner applications for published badges, forwarding the application data to the API. Applications can then be reviewed and the reviews submitted. Each application should be accompanied by evidence suited to the badge criteria - this is what an assessor will review when making awarding decisions.

_Note that when you create a new application, it should typically include evidence._

The [`Client`](methods.md) object provides the following methods:

* [`getApplications`](#getapplications-application)
* [`getApplication`](#getapplication-application)
* [`addApplication`](#addapplication-application)
* [`updateApplication`](#updateapplication-application)
* [`addReview`](#addreview-review)
* [`deleteReview`](#deletereview-review)
* [`getApplicationEvidence`](#getapplicationevidence-evidence)
* [`getApplicationEvidenceItem`](#getapplicationevidenceitem-evidence)
