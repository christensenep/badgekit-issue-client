# BadgeKit API Client Documentation

This project is a node.js client for [BadgeKit API](https://github.com/mozilla/badgekit-api). BadgeKit API provides back-end processing for issuing Open Badges. You can use the client to connect your BadgeKit API instance to your own earner-facing site or application. The client facilitates creating and managing data for badges, applications and admin levels (systems, issuers and programs).

## Using the Client

The [introduction](index.md) explains how to instantiate and use the client.

The [`Client` object method list](methods.md) links to detailed examples of client calls and responses.

The [models overview](models.md) explains how the client handles badging objects.
