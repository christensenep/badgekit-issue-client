# BadgeKit API Client Documentation

This project is a node.js client for [BadgeKit API](https://github.com/mozilla/badgekit-api). BadgeKit API provides back-end processing for issuing Open Badges. You can use the client to connect your BadgeKit API instance to your own earner-facing site or application. The client facilitates creating and managing data for badges, applications and admin levels (systems, issuers and programs).

__NB The [BadgeKit Web app](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-badgekit) uses this client so you can see it in action there.__

## Using the Client

For an introduction to instantiating and using the client, see the [docs index](index.md) page.
